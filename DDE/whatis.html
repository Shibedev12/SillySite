      <h1>About DanceDanceEngine:</h1>

      <p>DanceDanceEngine, better known as DDE and formerly DDS (DanceDanceSprigalution), was made in Hack Club's Javascript-based project, Sprig.</p>

      <p>DDE is a labor of love, made by me, Shibedev12. nobody else.</p>

      <p>DDE is made with Sprig. It is made to be edited, changed and fixed as time progresses!</p>

      <p>Here's a nonexhaustive list of everything that DDS can do:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add Custom BackGroundMusic!</li>
        <li>Adjust and make your own note patterns!</li>
        <li>Customize your note sprites, color swap and more!</li>
      </ul>
